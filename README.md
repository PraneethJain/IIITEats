## HomePage

By clicking on the canteen photos, you will be taken to the respective canteen's page, where you can choose the dish you want.

## Canteen's Page:

You can see the price of each food item. There is also a quantity metre where you can choose how many items of that food you want (a maximum of 5 allowed for a dish).
Please enter your name, hostel block, room number, phone number, and then submit after entering the quantities of all dishes you want. When you click Submit, you will be taken to the Pending Orders Page.

## Pending Order's Page:

Your Items are displayed on the Pending Order's Page. If anyone in the canteen accepts your order, a OTP will be generated, and your order will be moved to the accepted page.

## Accepted Page:

After your order is completed, the delivery person will enter the OTP on the Accepted Page. It demonstrates that the order was delivered and your order got removed from the database.

AND NOW YOUR FOOD IS IN YOUR HANDS.

## About Page:

You can learn more about our company on our About Page.

### Note

The purpose of the OTP is that only the person who has accepted your order can mark it as delivered. This prevents unauthorized access and doesn't let random people mark your order as delivered.
